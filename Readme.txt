Unity 2 - Assignment 1

On this project the new features added to the game are:

- When somebody (player or AI) captures an outpost, there is an audio playing.

- If the AI captures the outpost, they dance :)

- If the AI dies, the dead animation is played.

- The AI will attack only if the target is inside range.

- If the AI is in danger, they will move to the center of the scene, while recovering slowly health.

The new feature is based on the Nahual, a Mesoamerican urban leyend where a man has the power to change his human shape to animal shape.
